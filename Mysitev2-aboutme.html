<div id="idk"><span id="ms">My Story</span>: I was born and raised in Staten Island, ever since a young age I have been obsessed with computers and everything that goes on with tech. In middle and high school I took computer classes although high school was more to do with simply computer business. During my time in college I only had one class that involved coding but I loved it. I wanted to learn more but I had no interest for the rest of college so I looked for other solutions. This is when I found coding boot camps and programs. Since then I looked for the right one and stumbled upon NYCDA. When I saw their program I decided to take the plunge and start towards my goal of becoming a full stack web developer!</div>
</div>
<br>
<p id="para"> So Im actually an "aspiring" freelance web developer and photographer. Although photography is more of a hobby it has become an obsession and I feel something that can end up aiding my web development career. In the meantime I intend to and other languages like ruby on rails and python to my repertoire to make me a excellent full stack developer. </p>
